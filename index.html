<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white; font-size:32px; background-color:black; border:solid white;"><b>Why did I choose QA</b></h3>
    <hr>
	<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> I came to the field of software testing by chance. </p>
    <p>I worked for several years as a swimming instructor and lifeguard in swimming pools,
       And following 
	  <br>
	   the covid-19 crisis and the closing of the swimming pools, I started working in Wolt's customer service.</p>
    <p>During my work at Wolt, I noticed that I really connect to the technological field, to the ideas
      <br>
	in the conduct of the company and especially to the technical side which seems fascinating to me!</p>
    <p>And after a few months of working at Wolt, I started the QA studies, and
       <br>
	at the same time I continued to research and deepen my technical knowledge.</p>
       Today I am a junior QA, and I am looking for the workplace that will be my home and I will be his heart. </b>
       <br>	   
	    It was very exciting to study in the QA course, it was interesting and I loved learning about SQL and HTML
       <br>
	   <br>
	   <br>
	   <br>
	   This is me :)

    <hr>
	<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;">  
	  During the course of software testing,
      I did several projects:
     <br>
     <br>
     <u> Group project on a warehouse system:</u>
     <br>
     I really enjoyed working in a group, I learned from my friends and added my knowledge to them.
     <br>
     We worked with an orderly plan and used characterization
     <br>
     The tools we used were:
     <br>
     PowerPoint, Testrail, Jira, Zoom and we created an STP document and STR.
     <br> 
	 <br>
	 <u> A single project regarding a website: </u>
     <br>
     Working alone challenged me a lot, and strengthened my understanding that I have the ability to take command.
     <br>
     The whole project was mine and I completed it
     with my creativity and ideas.
     <br>
     I did this project without characterization, but I created a preliminary design and STR.
     <br>
     The tools I used:
	 Jira, PostMan, PowerPoint.
	 <br>
     <br>
     <u>Dual project regarding application: </u>
	 <br>
     The project was interesting in terms of the way we worked.
     <br>
     I really enjoyed the collaboration and I felt that my partner and I were helping and supporting each other.
     <br>
     In this project we did not have a characterization, but we did plan a set of work and tests.
     <br>
     The tools we used were:
     <br>
     PowerPoint, Monday, zoom.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 During the course I practiced and learned
     <br>
	 about several software and tools:
     <br>
     Notepad++, SQL Join-level, Selenium, CSS, HTML,
     <br>
	 STP, STD, STR, Agile, Jira, Postman,
     and more.
	 <br> 
     <br>
	 <br>
     I built this site with HTML through NotePad++, and uploaded it to the Internet through Github.
     <br>
     I built another website that explains my favorite hobby, which was also my profession:
     <br>

<h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b>  
     One of the things that is most important to me is maintaining a balance between body-mind-thought
     <br>
	 It is important for me to take care of myself, because life in an intense city like Tel Aviv can sometimes be overwhelming.
     <br>	
	 <br>
     <u> The important things I use: </u>
	 <br>
	 training in the gym, swimming and a healthy diet.
     <br>	
     I train 3-5 times a week in the gym and swim in the swimming pool
     <br>
      I eat proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins from vegetables in a balanced way.
	 <br>
	 <br>
     In addition, I really like to drive around the Tel Aviv area 
     <br>
     and enjoy the urban landscapes that the area has to offer.
     <br>
     <br>
     Another hobby I have is planning (and sometimes actually doing) trips around the world with friends,
     <br>
	 the main places we focus on are major European cities and islands around the world 
	 <br>
      i love to travel the world ,eat and taste special food and learn about new cultures
	  <br>
	  <Br>

	  This is me' in Hawaii :)
