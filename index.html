<ul><h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> - i use to work as a swimming instructor and lifeguard at pools in Tel Aviv. I liked it very much! </b></h3></ul>
<ul><h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> - It was very exciting to study in the QA course, it was interesting and I loved learning about SQL and HTML</b></h3></ul>
<ul><h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> - i love to travel the world ,eat and taste special food and learn about new cultures </b></h3></ul>
<ul><h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> - My hobbies are: working out in the gym, cooking, driving and learning new things in a wide variety of subjects</b></h3></ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center;background-color:black; color:white; font-size:32px; border:soild white;"> <b> things that I like to do in my free time.
 </b></h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> <p> One of the things that is most important to me is maintaining a balance between body-mind-thought<p/>
<p> It is important for me to take care of myself, because life in an intense city like Tel Aviv can sometimes be overwhelming. <p/>
<p> The two tools I use: training in the gym, swimming and a healthy diet. <p/>
<p> I train 3-5 times a week in the gym and swim in the swimming pool <p/>
<p> I eat proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins from vegetables in a balanced way.<p/>
<p> In addition, I really like to drive around the Tel Aviv area and enjoy the urban landscapes that the area has to offer.<p/>
<p> Another hobby I have is planning (and sometimes actually doing) trips around the world with friends, the main places we focus on are major European cities and islands around the world <p/></b></h3>

<h1 style="text-align:center;background-color:black; color:white; font-size:32px; border:soild white;"> <b> Why did I choose QA </b></h1>

<h3 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size:22px; border:soild white;"> <b> <p> I came to the field of software testing by chance. </p>
<p>I worked for several years as a swimming instructor and lifeguard in swimming pools,
And following the corona crisis and the closing of the swimming pools, I started working in Wolt's customer service.</p>
<p>During my work at Wolt, I noticed that I really connect to the technological field, to the ideas in the conduct of the company and especially to the technical side which seems fascinating to me!</p>
<p>And after a few months of working at Wolt, I started the QA studies, and at the same time I continued to research and deepen my technical knowledge.</p>
Today I am a junior QA, and I am looking for the workplace that will be my home and I will be his heart. </b></h3>
